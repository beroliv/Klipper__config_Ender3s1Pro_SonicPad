Klipper Configuration on SonicPad with Ender 3 s1 Pro. First flash the image from https://github.com/Jpe230/SonicPad-Debian
pls Check Crealitys Git hub on how to flash a Image on a Sonic Pad
printer.cfg is optimized for a Creality Ender 3 S1 Pro. If you have already a Custom firmware installed like the firmware from Thomas Tokka, install first Crealitys original Firmware otherwise it will not work
and the mcu will not cumunicate with the pad or Raspberry.
